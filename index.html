            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p></br>I am currently studying electrical engineering at the 
			University of Waterloo in Canada. I strive for excellence in all
			aspects of my life, and aspire to become a true model of success. 
			I am very enthusiastic about technology and educate myself as much 
			as possible through hands-on experience and personal projects. I try to stay active and keep myself busy with things 
			that interest me. 
			I truly believe it is the only way to be productive and achieve my goals!

			<h4>This Portfolio Website</h4>
			</br>
              <p>I created this website to develop my skills in web development. Having no prior
			  experience nor taken any classes on how to make a website, I quickly self-learned the basic
			  tools needed in forms of HTML and CSS. It was a fun project and I intend to continuously
			  modify and improve this website. I hope you like it!
			  </br></br>
			  Technologies used: HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, GitHub
              </p></br>

			  <h4>Remote Controlled Car</h4>
			  </br>
			  <p>In this project, I got the experience to etch and solder electronic components on printed circuits boards. I drilled
			    onto the etched PCB where I used a template circuit design for this project.
				I also programmed the car using PIC chips in MPLAB assembly. A simple two-wheel motor engine was used for this robot car. 
				This was indeed a fun project! 
				</br></br>
				Technologies used: Soldering iron, MPLAB assembly, PIC, LEDs and other various electronic components</p>

            <h2>Interests</h2>
			<p></br>My interests vary a lot from sports to music to electronics.
			I have been playing the guitar for over 10 years and continuously improved my guitar techniques. My knowledge on music theory has also
			tremendously increased over the years since I've started playing. Moreover, I enjoy making my own songs and practice guitar solo improvisations
			using loop pedals.</br>
			<br>
			I also have a deep passion for any types of sports and in particular, soccer. I have been watching and following soccer ever since I was a kid. I 
			occasionally partake in the university's intramural league. I still try to keep up and stay healthy even with my busy school life.
			</br>
			<br>Other activities that also interest me are photography, hiking, cooking and singing.</p>
